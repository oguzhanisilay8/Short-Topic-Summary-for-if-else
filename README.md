# Short Topic Summary: for + if/else (R)

This repository contains beginner-level teaching materials for **bioinformatics students** who are learning **R programming**, specifically focusing on:

- `for` loops
- `if / else` conditional statements
- Using control structures together
- Applying these concepts to simple biological examples

The content is designed to be **clear, minimal, and pedagogically consistent** with introductory bioinformatics curricula (e.g. YBVA).

## Contents

The material covers the following topics:

### 1. `for` Loops
- Iterating over vectors
- Accessing elements one by one
- Storing results in vectors
- Everyday-life analogies for loops

### 2. `if / else` Statements
- Logical conditions (`TRUE` / `FALSE`)
- Single and multiple conditions
- Decision-making in code

### 3. Combining `for` + `if / else`
- Classifying numerical data
- Making decisions for each element in a dataset

### 4. Biological Examples
All examples are intentionally **simple and explicit**, avoiding advanced R functions.

- DNA nucleotide inspection (GC vs AT)
- GC content calculation using counters
- Simple motif detection (e.g. start codon `ATG`)
- Enzyme activity at different temperatures
