# Short Topic Summary: for + if / else (R)

This repository contains beginner-level teaching material for bioinformatics students who are learning R programming, with a specific focus on control structures.

The content focuses on:

- `for` loops  
- `if / else` conditional statements  
- Using control structures together  
- Applying these concepts to simple biological examples  

The material is designed to be clear, minimal, and pedagogically consistent with introductory bioinformatics curricula (e.g., YBVA).

## Contents

This material covers the following topics:

### 1. for Loops
- Iterating over vectors  
- Accessing elements one by one  
- Storing results in vectors  
- Everyday-life analogies for loops  

### 2. if / else Statements
- Logical conditions (`TRUE` / `FALSE`)  
- Single and multiple conditions  
- Decision-making in code  

### 3. Combining for + if / else
- Classifying numerical data  
- Making decisions for each element in a dataset  

### 4. Biological Examples
All examples are intentionally simple and explicit, avoiding advanced R functions.

Examples include:

- DNA nucleotide inspection (GC vs AT)  
- GC content calculation using counters  
- Simple motif detection (e.g., start codon ATG)  
- Enzyme activity at different temperatures

## Educational Philosophy

This project follows a step-by-step and learner-centered approach:

- No advanced or previously unseen R functions are used  
- All logic is built gradually and clearly  
- Emphasis is placed on understanding how the computer processes instructions  
- Biological meaning is explained alongside programming logic
